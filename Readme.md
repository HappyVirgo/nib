# NIB

## [Demo](https://jpuri.github.io/Nib/)

Despite various options available for rich text editing in html, it continues to be extremely challenging area. I found [prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net) to be the best available solution for the problem. It is great work by author [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/).

Making an editor ground up from a framework is still much work, the project aims at building components for rich text editing using prosemirror. These components can be quickly integrated into react or even ron-react applications.

## Setup

Setup of the editor is quite straight forward. It is required to be installed from `npm`.

### Installing packages:

Either `npm` or `yarn` commands can be used.

```
npm i nib-core --save
```

### Writing editor component:

```
import React from "react";
import Editor from "nib-core";

const MyEditor = () => <Editor />;
```
