Despite various options available for rich text editing in html, it continues to be extremely challenging area. I found [prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net) to be one of the best available solutions for the problem. It is great work by author [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/).

Making an editor ground up from a framework is still much work, the project aims at building components for rich text editing using prosemirror. These components can be quickly integrated into react or even ron-react applications.

If you have any further queries or require any help you can [email](mailto::jyotipuri@gmail.com) me.
